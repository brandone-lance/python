Toy neural network for python, only partly my own work.

Uses CSV files labeled "input.csv" and "train.csv" for training network. The nn.forward function 
can then be used for testing/predictions, at your own peril. iMax on line 64ish controls the number
of iterations over which network is trained, and hiddenSize on line 11ish controls the size of the
hidden layer.

This is pretty rough around the edges. Mostly this was to teach myself the basics of how a neural
network can be built from the ground up. In that respect, it serves its purpose.
